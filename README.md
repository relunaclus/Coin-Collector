### Project Outline

Coin Collector is a simple top down 2D idle style game with simplistic graphics that takes inspiration from many .io style games and other idle games, most notably "Agar.io."
It fits the theme "pocket" as the player controls a coin with the goal of collecting more coins, inspired by the concept of losing change in a pocket. As the player collects coins, new coins will spawn and the player will increase in size. Additionally, the score above the player will increase, this score can be used in order to buy upgrades which let the player increase point generation even further.

### Research

#### Methodology

Upon learning the project's theme was pocket I very quickly decided to create a game themed around loose change in a pocket. My initial idea is to create a game where the player controls a coin with a certain amount of money, and has the goal to collect more coins to increase both their value and size while avoiding other obstacles typical to the environment of a pocket such as lint or paper which would damage the player causing them to lose value. As the player gains more points, the player's size increases and it becomes more difficult to avoid obstacles.

I began by taking influence from another game where the player gains size as they gain score, being Agar.io (Agar.io, s.d.), a simple but popular multiplayer game where each player controls a cell in search of resources to increase in size.

The obstacles and challenges in Agar.io mostly come from other players, who, if their cell is larger than yours, can eat it and grow much faster than eating the non-player resources. In addition, you can press the W key in order to split your cell into two different cells, propelling one forward. This can be used tactically as a quick escape from danger at the cost of lowering your effectiveness by decreasing your size.

A more complex example of the same general gameplay idea is from SPORE (SPORE™ on Steam, s.d.), a game from 2008 with 5 stages, but the stage I have focused on is the cell stage, which has similar basic cell gameplay to Agar.io with increased complexity as different parts can be added to your cell to modify its effectivity in various ways such as increasing speed, changing the types of food that can be eaten, or adding self-defensive features such as spikes or poison to increase the chance of survival.

During the game creation process, I conducted guiding testing with multiple of my peers in order to gather data to understand how to improve the game and identify any bugs that may crop up, all data used was done so with the consent of all who answered it that it would be used to improve the game.

- process of research, testing, how approach project
 - you will be looking at examples of these types of games
 - you will be doing guided testing and collecting data

#### Game Sources

- games you have researched

A game that Coin Collector takes major influence from is Agar.io, an .io style game where players compete for resources to increase the size of their "cell" allowing them to then overpower and destroy other players to further increase their size.


- use zotero

#### Academic Sources

- use library
- and zotero
- or google scholar
- academic sources of some description which have guided you

#### Documentation Sources

- youtube tutorials
- documentation like raylib cheatsheet or unreal documentation

### Implementation

#### Process

- how game made
- how game made work

#### New Approaches

- new things started using
- raylib, unreal
- how approach new things

### User Testing

- graphs and stuff
- how users felt on first test
- show data
- how users felt on second test, or benchmark
- guided test or blind test

### Outcome

- youtube video of demonstrating game
- trailer if wanted
- link to itch.io
- anything important, test in incognito browser or on phone

#### Instructions to Run/Install

- how to install and run the game
- or how to interact with source code
- or how to make the game if weird toolchain

### Reflection

#### Research Effectiveness

- was research helpful

#### Positive Analysis

- why is game good
- what went well

#### Negative Analysis

- why is game bad
- what did not go well
- what was missing

#### Next Time
