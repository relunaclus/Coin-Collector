### Project Outline

Coin Collector is a simple top down 2D idle style game with simplistic graphics that takes inspiration from many .io style games and other idle games, most notably "Agar.io."
It fits the theme "pocket" as the player controls a coin with the goal of collecting more coins, inspired by the concept of losing change in a pocket. As the player collects coins, new coins will spawn and the player will increase in size. Additionally, the score above the player will increase, this score can be used in order to buy upgrades which let the player increase point generation even further.

### Research

#### Methodology
- process of research, testing, how approach project
 - you will be looking at examples of these types of games
 - you will be doing guided testing and collecting data

#### Game Sources

- games you have researched

A game that Coin Collector takes major influence from is Agar.io, an .io style game where players compete 
- use zotero

#### Academic Sources

- use library
- and zotero
- or google scholar
- academic sources of some description which have guided you

#### Documentation Sources

- youtube tutorials
- documentation like raylib cheatsheet or unreal documentation

### Implementation

#### Process

- how game made
- how game made work

#### New Approaches

- new things started using
- raylib, unreal
- how approach new things

### User Testing

- graphs and stuff
- how users felt on first test
- show data
- how users felt on second test, or benchmark
- guided test or blind test

### Outcome

- youtube video of demonstrating game
- trailer if wanted
- link to itch.io
- anything important, test in incognito browser or on phone

#### Instructions to Run/Install

- how to install and run the game
- or how to interact with source code
- or how to make the game if weird toolchain

### Reflection

#### Research Effectiveness

- was research helpful

#### Positive Analysis

- why is game good
- what went well

#### Negative Analysis

- why is game bad
- what did not go well
- what was missing

#### Next Time

- what was learned
- what you want to do more of
- what is guiding your interests
- what do i regret (everything)

### References

- use zotero

### Declared Assets

- declare any ai used and what they were used for

- this ai used to alter following files
    - list models of ai used
    - list files modified

- declare asset packs, anything i didn't make and am using wow
(make sure im allowed to use it)
